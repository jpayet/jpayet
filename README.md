Hi ! <br />
**I'm _web developer_ - _student at the IUT of Troyes in Multim√©dia and Internet_ (BAC +1 to BAC +3)** <br />

Start Coding in 2020 in High School, I learnt _Python_ basics and Front development _(HTML-CSS)_. Then I decided to join the University to improve my web development skills. 

Today I'm currently studying **Front-End development** _(HTML-CSS-JS)_ but I'm major in **Back-End development** _(PHP-MYSQL)_. 
On my github, you could find some of my work that I'm or was working on. <br />
