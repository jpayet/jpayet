Hi ! <br />
**I'm _web developer_ - _student at the IUT of Troyes in Multim√©dia and Internet_ (BAC +1 to BAC +3)** <br />
Start Coding in 2020 in High School, I learnt üêçPython basics and Front development (HTML - CSS). Then I decided to join the University to improve my web development skills. 
Today I'm currently studying **Front-End development** (HTML-CSS-JS) but I'm major in **Back-End development** (PHP-MYSQL). 
On my github, you could find some of my work that I'm or was working on. <br />

Take a look !
